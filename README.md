This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I have implemented both server-side rendering and incremental static regeneration to optimize both speed and performance. The project is hooked up to a Sanity CMS to make content management simple. It also uses a custom API endpoint to allow users to comment on articles. Styled using a mobile-first responsive design inherent in TailwindCSS.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
